I am a postdoctoral researcher at IFAU, Sweden and I hold a PhD in Economics from Lund University.

My main research field is labor economics, with a focus on topics on gender and how early childhood experiences influence long-term outcomes. I also have a growing interest in education-related topics, particularly how policies and interventions shape human capital development across different stages of life.
