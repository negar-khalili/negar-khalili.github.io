I am currently pursuing a PhD in Economics at Lund University, with an interest in applied economics and causal inference.  

My main research field is labor economics, with a focus on topics on gender and how early childhood experiences influence long-term outcomes. I also have a growing interest in education-related topics, particularly how policies and interventions shape human capital development across different stages of life.  

  
I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market.
