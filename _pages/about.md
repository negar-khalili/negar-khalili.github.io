I am currently pursuing a PhD in Economics at Lund University, with an interest in applied economics and causal inference.  

My primary focus lies at the intersection of labor and gender economics and how early childhood experiences influence long-term outcomes. I also have a growing interest in education-related topics, particularly how policies and interventions shape human capital development across different stages of life.  

  
I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market.
